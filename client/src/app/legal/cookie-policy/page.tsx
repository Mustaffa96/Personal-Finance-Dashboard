        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an application. Cookies are widely used by website owners and application providers to make their websites and applications work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How We Use Cookies</h2>
